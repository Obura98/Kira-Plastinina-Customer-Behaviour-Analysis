# Kira-Plastinina-Customer-Behaviour-Analysis
Kira Plastinina customer behavior analysis in R.  Learning the characteristics of customer groups.

# 1. Problem Definition
## 1.1 Defining the Question
Kira Plastinina  is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year.
## 1.2 Specifying the Question
Create a model that helps KIra Plastinina  learn the characteristics of customer groups
## 1.3  Defining the Metric of Success
- model that predicts accurately with an accuracy score of 80% whether a user will click on an ad or not
- Give insights to the company concerning their brand from the EDA done
- Challenge and improve the created unsupervied model
## 1.4 Understanding the Context
 Kira Plastininais a Russian fashion designer and entrepreneur. Her brand was sold through a now defunct chain of eponymous retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippinesand Armenia
Plastinina was born in Moscow. Her father, Sergei Plastinin, founded Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods OJSC in 1992 and served as its Chief Executive Officer until April 3, 2006. He was impressed with his daughter's passion for design and vision of teenage fashion, and suggested that they launch a fashion brand together.In 2007, the first Kira Plastinina store opened in Moscow, Plastinina introduced her first collection and became one of the youngest fashion designers in the world. Since then, the company has opened over 300 stores in Russia and CIS. In 2008, the Company made an unsuccessful attempt to enter the U.S. market. The U.S. entity eventually filed for bankruptcy. With out analysis segmentation, we can identify why her brand failed in the US maybe help her in her customer segmentation

## 1.5 Experimental Design taken
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning and Formatting
3. Univariate Analysis
4. Bivariate Analysis
5. Multivariate Analysis
6. Implementing the solution through unsupervised machine learning,i.e. k-means, hierachical and DBSCAN
6. Conclusion and Next steps
# 2. Data Sourcing
The data was availed to our data science team by the  brand’s Sales and Marketing team therefore no data collection and
